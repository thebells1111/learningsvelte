**User Story #10:** I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

**User Story #11:** The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
